<div class = "move"><h2 class = "title">Publication #1: Jordan Government Flood Mapping Program</h2></div>
  
<div class = "move"><h3 class = "head5"><p>Damages resulting from flooding can be catastrophic ranging from impacts like displacing families, causing major economic loss, casualties and environmental damages. Flooding damages in Jordan in particular have been rampant in the past years, which has resulted in many casualties. In one particular incident, around 4000 visitors had to be evacuated in Petra because of flash floods which led had to the death of 13 people from. In order to effectively combat this, the government of Jordan (under the Ministry of Water & Irrigation) implemented the National Flood Mapping Program which sets out to reduce the risks of flooding. Accurate flood maps are required to effectively communicate flood risk to families, communities, officials and stakeholders. These flood risk maps serve as an important decision-making tool to assists in flood mitigation, emergency management and land use planning. These maps provide imperative information regarding flood risks, hazards, topography and land cover and at large scales (from 1:1000 to 1:25000). With the new mapping program, the government aims to identify and examine the associated risks with flooding along with developing mitigation measures. Along with having a flood risk mapping program, implementing a variety of other effective and affordable flood management techniques must be used to reduce the impacts of flooding in Jordan. However, flood management methods are usually in conflict with water supply needs. Such techniques being used include zoning non-structural and structural procedures and spatial planning measures. Moreover, the mapping program has an objective of providing crucial information to help in developing an integrated approach to flood risk management.

<div class = "move"><h2 class = "title">Publication #2: The Significance of Crisis Mapping</h2></div>
  
<div class = "move"><h3 class = "head5"><p>Crisis mapping has had an instrumental part in humanitarian efforts and has gone through numerous enhancements throughout the years. In the article titled, “When Disaster Strikes, He Creates A 'Crisis Map' That Helps Save Lives” by Hannah Bloch she discusses how crisis mapping has gone through changes during the years from the use of online maps to drones and social media. During the earthquake at Haiti, crisis mapping was still relatively new and had not been developed as an effective means to aid against global emergencies. During this time, Patrick Meier a leading digital humanitarian had initiated the creation of a crisis map for Haiti that can be shared online and can constantly be updated in real time. Meier and his colleagues started to gather information from social media including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and added that to the base map of Haiti. They had mapped out points with red dots which indicated which pharmacies were open, roads that were blocked, people who were stuck and required assistance. Eventually other rescue teams like the United States Marines and FEMA had recognized the crisis map and started using information from the map. The advancement of crisis mapping includes using drones and advanced robotics.Crisis mapping allows a broad set of tasks which offer filtering, analysis of information, categorization and geolocated visualization and also allows people from the public and other crisis responders to contribute information to the map. Crisis mapping now makes use of a multitude of methods and techniques ranging from aerial and satellite imagery and geospatial platforms to advanced visualization, live simulations and statistical and computational models. A major benefit of crisis mapping is that it has the ability to raise situational awareness as the public can help report data and information and improve management of them as well. Moreover, this form of mapping works with data from various sources and can have many purposes.

<div class = "move"><h2 class = "title">Publication #3: Remote Sensing & Satellite Mapping in Humanitarian Efforts</h2></div>
  
<div class = "move"><h3 class = "head5"><p> Without a doubt, remote sensing & satellite mapping has had a profound importance in terms of its many uses worldwide in a variety of fields such as agriculture, military, emergency management, conservation, water resources management and more. It has also been used extensively in crisis mapping and for humanitarian efforts. An article by Rich Donnelly in 2012, titled “Crisis Mapping - Satellite mapping provides relief workers with advance information” discusses the important functions that satellite mapping has in various emergency response management and relief efforts across the globe. As part of the European Commission, the Joint Research Centre relies on the precise information of the analysis of remote sensing and its data. The author goes on to explain how the work done delivers relief workers with specific information regarding damaged infrastructure such as road networks and buildings.Another new methodology designed from the JRC (Joint Research Centre) involves the automated recognition of refugees and other displaced persons through earth observation imagery and remote sensing. In Sudan, an imaging tool from the WorldView-2 satellite offers great results using each eight spectral brands from its senor. This satellite is able to gather around 785,000-square kilometers of 8-band imagery every day. Another satellite, the DigitalGlobal satellite works from 770 kilometers above the earths surface and gives a 1.85-meter multispectral resolution and a 46 cm panchromatic resolution. Both satellites provide amazing opportunities in their objective of assisting displaced people throughout the world.Even in the U.S. military, there is a need for IR (and remote sensing technologies as they propose new opportunities for advancements. At the DSS (SPIE - Defense, Security, and Sensing), panelists at a funding session explained how companies developing new sensing devices and technologies for refining image resolution for soldiers would find quite an audience among American defense agencies. Brent Appleby of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) states how the use of intelligence and surveillance make use of  remote sensing and earth observation imagery by integrating it into their work as they are used to help look for people, things that are hidden, and many more applications. Another important use of remote sensing comes from the use of solar panels for fish farms particularly in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010, as they are helping to the contribution of economic abundance. In the Caribbean Harvest Foundation fish hatchery, the solar panels deliver almost 15KW of electricity which allows the rise of production in fish-farming jobs and tilapia (key fish species). Many different organizations are supporting solar energy projects in Haiti and around the world including the Clinton Global Initiative, the Solar Electric Light Fund and NRG Energy. All in all, remote sensing and satellite imagery have a great importance in the betterment of the world and continues to advance immensely as time goes on.

<div class = "move"><h2 class = "title">Publication #4: India’s Use of the Geospatial Sewerage Surveillance System to Combat COVID-19</h2></div>
  
<div class = "move"><h3 class = "head5"><p>The coronavirus situation has had a devastating consequence worldwide and many preventative solutions are being implemented and designed to help combat the situation. India has been one of the countries hit the hardest and many answers are required to alleviate the issue. In India the government has introduced the use of a geospatial sewerage surveillance system to detect traces of COVID-19 in specific regions and communities. The company doing so is Transerve Technologies (Indian start-up) which specializes in location intelligence using geospatial technology. They offer a geospatial analysis platform (Transerve Online Stack) to assist clients visualize and process geospatial data. Users are able to design forms, gather information at a small & large scale with location-integration, as well as managing, examining and publishing it online. Many studies have been done worldwide which shown that a significant fraction of people with active COVID-19 cases actually shed the virus in their stool, in some cases before the symptoms even begin. Each time someone with the virus uses the bathroom, the virus enters the wastewater system. Sewage and wastewater testing can be used as an early warning sign for the virus and this surveillance model delivers community-based group testing with repetitive monitoring of sewage as a non-invasive early caution tool. This model may not only be used as an early warning sign for COVID-19 but for potential outbreaks as well. Moreover, this model has also been effectively used in detecting illegal drug use in Australia, to tracking salmonella outbreaks in Haiti, and to fight diseases such as polio in Israel. The way the surveillance program works is through a cloud-based tool (Transerve Online Stack) which works by tracking the movement of faecal sludge management (FSM) by gathering data via spatial analytics, studying patterns over time and location on mobile devices. The process revolves around configuring optimal samples from FSM truck routes, nodal collection point and community aggregation points. Once the necessary testing has been completed, if extra positive coronavirus cases are noticed within the community, then that precise community will be cautioned for the suitable actions to be taken. Furthermore, cities have the ability to provide the network of sewerage pipelines with locations for manholes which can be used for sample collection and setting boundaries for virus traces. This can be aid in the formation of containment zones within the local level. This method can also be effective in a variety of areas including rural, urban and impoverished areas such as slums where an outbreak is more probable. Seeing that the coronavirus is a humanitarian issue, the need for the field of geomatics is essential to assist in developing a multitude of solutions, warnings & support systems and more. There are a ton of other geospatial methods being implemented to combat COVID-19 and the Geospatial Sewerage Surveillance is just one of them. As more research and studies are being carried out across the globe, the method of measuring COVID-19 in wastewater and sewage systems (gauge levels of COVID-19 traces in communities) through geomatics have an amazing potential to improve public health worldwide.

<div class = "move"><h2 class = "title">Publication #5: Low-Emission Vehicles & Air Pollution Mapping in California, USA</h2></div>
  
<div class = "move"><h3 class = "head5"><p>Air pollution is a huge emission issue throughout the world in places such as India and China. Moreover, in California the issue of air pollution has been rampant for a very long time. Three major reasons are specified for the unnatural levels of air pollution in California and this includes the mountainous terrain which entraps air pollutants, the warm climate which assists in the formation of air pollutants and the activities of the 39 million residents currently living in California. Numerous studies which can be found online have demonstrated that air pollutants that are prominent in California are connected to an extensive range of health issues such as lung cancer, birth complications, premature death and asthma. A California-based company, Aclima is one of the leading organizations in greenhouse gas & air quality analysis & measurements. The platform and work done by Aclima assists communities and government speed up the necessary actions which will in turn reduce emissions and protect public health. They had found from an earlier research that the level of air pollutions in Oakland, California vary drastically as much as 800% between just blocks in the community. Aclima now along with recently joined researcher Crystal Upperman are analyzing and mapping emissions in Brooklyn through the use of low-emission vehicles which are equipped with sensing and measuring technology. Upperman will work to provide an oversight of the efforts done by the company in order to accordingly incorporate risk characterization and public health information/data into the products of Aclima. The data will be gathered through days and nights for 3 months and the results will permit residents to observe just how much pollution they are being exposed to at work, school, home, etc. By doing this, specific sources of air pollution can be pin-pointed and identified. In doing so, communities will be able to enforce stricter policies and laws regarding the reduction of air pollution emissions. This will in turn help protect the public from the negative impacts of air pollution and will help slow down the impacts of climate change. You can visit the Aclima website to learn more about them, https://www.aclima.io.

<div class = "move"><h2 class = "title">Publication #6: SkyWatch Space Applications Inc & Earth Observation Datae</h2></div>
  
<div class = "move"><h3 class = "head5"><p>Two recent pieces discussed the earth observation company SkyWatch and their recent financing which has enabled the exponential growth of the company. Based in Waterloo, Canada SkyWatch is an organization that has built a distribution platform for satellite imagery. James Slifierz, SkyWatch’s chief executive stated that the company has no goal of launching its own satellites, rather they focus specifically on the downstream earth observation imagery market. SkyWatch includes optical and synthetic aperture radar data and plans to eventually include hyperspectral data. Their primary objective is to make earth observation data more accessible worldwide and simpler to access. The SkyWatch customer base has grown and now has 10 times the number of customers since it started. The earth observation market is expected to earn roughly $56 billion (CAD) in combined revenue over the next ten years. The main obstacle to further growth is reaching new non-traditional customers within the private sector, which has been a challenge. Nonetheless, with the new financing received for SkyWatch, the company will be able to strengthen its global partnership program, allowing the support of more than dozens of other companies that use TerraStream to distribute their satellite imagery and data. Ultimately, the rise of satellite imagery use has shown to be an important step in the progression of geomatics as a whole and will be promising for the future. With over 80% of the readers here on the GoGeomatics magazine being consumers of EA data, the hope is SkyWatch will continue to engage with the Canadian geospatial sector.
