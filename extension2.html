<p class = "class1"> The final project that I did at Guelph involved greenhouses in Leamington, Ontario and their biosecurity. Specifically, the health of cucumber, tomato and pepper crops as they become jeopardized due to the presence of plants and pathogens, particularly the pepper weevil that enter the greenhouse through non-agricultural pathways. The purpose was to provide industry specialists with an understanding of common greenhouse pests and their methods of transmission (within and between greenhouses) with the objective of improving biosecurity within greenhouse systems.</p>


<p class = "class1">My roles included providing relevant sources for the annotated bibliography, gathering & evaluating information, final report preparation, assisting in developing the work plan, preparation of final compliance practices & recommendations. I also formed the goals/objectives section and was involved in forming literature review. </p></div>
